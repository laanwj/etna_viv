Kernel driver
==============

Module parameters
------------------

The exact module parameters available depend on the kernel driver version
(see respective `gc_hal_kernel_driver.c`). Important initialisation parameters are,
along with the values on a RK2918 device:

    baseAddress     0           Physical memory base address
    signal          48          Realtime signal to use for kernel-user communication (only used if USE_NEW_LINUX_SIGNAL)
    bankSize        16777216    Bank size for video memory allocation (16777216 is the usual value)
    contiguousBase  0x78000000  Start physical memory address for "contiguous memory" (unified gpu-cpu memory)
    contiguousSize  0x08000000  Size of "contiguous memory" in bytes. This will be exclusive reserved for the driver from the memory available on the device!
    registerMemSize 16384       Size of MMIO area
    registerMemBase 0x10120000  Base address of MMIO area
    irqLine         41          IRQ line used for signals from GPU
    major           199         Major device node for /dev/galcore

Most important to get right are registerMemSize, registerMemBase and irqLine as these allow the driver to find and
communicate with the GPU hardware. They depend on the board, not on the GPU. For example, on a CuBox these settings are:
    
    irqLine         42
    registerMemBase 0xf1840000
    contiguousBase  0x08000000

The `dove` (cubox) driver also has a `gpu_frequency` parameter that sets the AXICLK/GCCLK clock at startup,
if compiled with `ENABLE_GPU_CLOCK_BY_DRIVER`. Some devices may need this, although not the CuBox itself (it is disabled in the makefile).
In that case your GPU will have an entry `GC` in `/proc/clocks`. 

On a Freescale i.MX6 (GK802) device the parameters are:

    irqLine           41
    irqLine2D         42
    irqLineVG         43
    registerMemBase   0x00130000
    registerMemBase2D 0x00134000
    registerMemBaseVG 0x02204000
    registerMemSize   16384
    registerMemSize2D 16384
    registerMemSizeVG 16384
    contiguousBase    0x34000000
    contiguousSize    0x0c000000  (192 MB)
    coreClock         156000000
    signal            48
    baseAddress       0 

Diagnostics
==============

There are various ways to get information about the current status of the GPU from user space.
One of these is the file /proc/driver/gc, which has the following contents (on dove):

    Marvell Technology Group Ltd(GC Ver0.8.0.3184-1)
    DEBUG VERSION
    idle register: 0xfe, hardware is busy
    clockControl register: 0x100
    print mode:     Pid(0) Reset(1) DumpCmdBuf(0)
    GC memory usage profile:
    Total reserved video memory: 65535 KB
    Used video mem: 0 KB    contiguous: 0 KB        virtual: 0 KB
    MMU Entries usage(PageCount): Total(32768), Used(0)

This shows the value of the idle register (`IDLE_STATE`, 0x0004), along with the clock
control register (`CLOCK_CONTROL`, 0x0000), various debug/print flags,
and memory usage information.

/proc/driver/gc can also be used to control the driver, with various commands (`gc_hal_kernel_driver`).

    echo xx > /proc/driver/gc

    printPID

Toggle print PID status.

    powerDebug

Toggle power debug status.

    profile <step> <timeSlice> <tailTimeSlice> <idleThreshold>

    debug <level> <zone>

Change debug level. Level is one of:

- `NONE` -1
- `ERROR` 0
- `WARNING` 1
- `INFO` 2
- `VERBOSE` 3

Zone is a bitfield consisting of:

- OS              1
- HARDWARE        2
- HEAP            4
- KERNEL          8
- VIDMEM          16
- COMMAND         32
- DRIVER          64
- CMODEL          128
- MMU             256
- EVENT           512
- DEVICE          1024

The reply in dmesg will show `INFO`, `WARNING` or `ERROR` as `NONE`.

    1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64

Change frequency to 1/x, use `1` to change to full speed.

User to kernel interface
========================

At startup, the application connects to galcore device using `open` with the device

- `/dev/galcore`, or
- `/dev/graphics/galcore`

After connecting to the device the entire chunk of contiguous memory, after requesting its address and size, 
is mapped into user space using `mmap`. The kernel will return addresses in this range when the user space driver allocates
contiguous (unified) memory used for communication with the GPU. 

Ioctl
-------

Communication with the kernel driver happens through ioctl calls on the resulting file descriptor. The following request ids are defined:

- `IOCTL_GCHAL_INTERFACE` (30000)
- `IOCTL_GCHAL_KERNEL_INTERFACE` (30001)
- `IOCTL_GCHAL_TERMINATE` (30002)

`IOCTL_GCHAL_INTERFACE` is the only one of these that is actually used by the userspace blob. This ioctl is passed one argument
which is a pointer to the following structure:

    typedef struct 
    {
        void *in_buf;
        uint32_t in_buf_size;
        void *out_buf;
        uint32_t out_buf_size;
    } vivante_ioctl_data_t;

When used by the blob, `in_buf` and `out_buf` point to the same memory address: a `gcsHAL_INTERFACE` structure that is 
used both for input and output arguments.

Command structure
------------------
The `gcsHAL_INTERFACE` (defined in `gc_hal_driver`) is the structure used by the driver to communicate with the 
kernel. It can be seen as a communication packet with a command opcode and an union with parameters. 
Depending on the `command` a different field of this union is used. The same structure is used both for input and output
arguments. 

For example, the command `gcvHAL_ALLOCATE_LINEAR_VIDEO_MEMORY` (I will leave off the `gcvHAL_` from now on) 
uses the fields in `interface->u.AllocateLinearVideoMemory` to pass in the number of bytes to allocate, but 
also to pass out the number of bytes actually allocated. 

What is curious about the ioctl protocol is that the communication structures contains fields that are not 
used by the kernel at all. There is no good reason why these values would need 
to be present in kernel-facing structures. The line is blurry sometimes.
It also appears that the structure has been designed with platform-independence in mind, and so some of the fields are not used in the Linux
drivers such as `status`, `handle`, `pid`.

A possibly worthwhile long-term goal would be to clean up the kernel driver interface. This would break compatibility with
the Vivante binary blobs, though, so maybe the effort would be better spent building a fully-fledged DRM/DRI 
infrastructure driver instead.

Allocations
------------
Memory management happens in the kernel. Two types of memory are allocated:

- Contiguous memory

  Used for command buffers
  Allocated with command `ALLOCATE_CONTIGUOUS_MEMORY`

  Reserved system memory that is contiguous (not fragmented by MMU) and mapped into GPU memory
  It looks like the blob driver also allocates a signal for each contigous memory block, how does this get used?

- Linear video memory

  Used for render targets, textures, surfaces, vertex buffers, bitmaps.
  The type of usage is specified by allocating the memory (see `gceSURF_TYPE` in `gc_hal_enum.h`).
  Allocated with command `ALLOCATE_LINEAR_VIDEO_MEMORY`

  Device memory, from one of the pools (default, local, unified or contiguous system memory)
  The available pools depend on the hardware; many of the devices have no local memory, and simply 
  use a part of system memory as video memory.

`LOCK_VIDEO_MEMORY` locks the video memory both 
- into the GPU memory space so that it can be used by the GPU
- into CPU memory so that the application can read/write. 
It is interesting that these are done by
the same call.

Command buffers
-------------------

Like many other GPUs, the primary means of programming the chip is through a command stream 
interpreted by a DMA engine. This "Front End" takes care of distributing state changes through
the individual modules of the GPU, kicking off primitive rendering, synchronization, 
and also supports some primitive flow control (branch, call, return).

The command stream is submitted to the kernel by means of command buffers. As most important part these 
structures contain a pointer to contiguous memory (allocated with command `ALLOCATE_CONTIGUOUS_MEMORY`) 
where the commands start.

Command buffers are built in user space by the driver in a `gcoCMDBUF` structure, then submitted to the kernel with the 
`COMMIT` command. 

The following structure fields of `gcoCMDBUF` are used by the kernel:

- `object`: marks the type of object (`gcvOBJ_COMMANDBUFFER`)
- `physical`: physical address of command buffer
- `logical`: logical (user space) address of command buffer
- `bytes`: size of command buffer memory block in bytes
- `startOffset`: offset at which to start sending command buffer (in bytes)
- `offset`: end offset (in bytes)
- `free`: number of free bytes in command buffer

User signal API
----------------
Command `USER_SIGNAL` is used for synchronization signals between the kernel and userspace driver. 

Note: the contents in this section only apply as-is if the kernel was *not* compiled with `USE_NEW_LINUX_SIGNAL`. If this
flag was set, then a posix real-time signal will be used to notify the process of incoming signals, and the 
`USER_SIGNAL_WAIT` is a no-op.

The subcommands are:

- `USER_SIGNAL_CREATE` Create a new signal
  Inputs: 
     - manualReset
     If set to gcvTRUE, the `SIGNAL` command must be used with state false to
     reset the signal. If set to gcvFALSE, the signal automatically resets
     after waiting for it with `WAIT`.
     - signalType (more recent dove kernel only), type of signal, appearantly only used for debugging

  Outputs: id

- `USER_SIGNAL_DESTROY` Destroy the signal
  Inputs: id
  Outputs: N/A

- `USER_SIGNAL_SIGNAL` Signal the signal
  Inputs: id, state
    - id    Signal id to signal
    - state If gcvTRUE, the signal will be set to signaled state, if gcvFALSE
             the signal will be set to nonsignaled state.
  Outputs: N/A

- `USER_SIGNAL_WAIT` Wait on the signal (block current thread)
  Inputs: 
    - id     Signal id to wait for
    - wait   Maximum duration to wait (in milliseconds)
  Outputs: N/A

- `USER_SIGNAL_MAP` Map the signal
  Inputs: id
  Outputs: N/A

- `USER_SIGNAL_UNMAP` Same as destroy
  Inputs: id
  Outputs: N/A

This is used to synchronize GPU and CPU. 
Signals can be scheduled to be signalled/unsignalled when the GPU finished a certain operation (using an Event).
They are also used for inter-thread synchronization by the EGL driver.

The event queue effectively schedules kernel operations to happen in the future, when the GPU has finished processing the currently
committed command buffers. This can be used to implement, for example, a fenced free that will release a buffer as soon as the GPU
is finished with it.

Event queues are sent to the kernel using the command `HAL_EVENT_COMMIT`. Types of interfaces that can be sent using an event are:

- `FREE_NON_PAGED_MEMORY`: free earlier allocated non paged memory
- `FREE_CONTIGUOUS_MEMORY`: free earier allocated contiguous memory
- `FREE_VIDEO_MEMORY`: free earlier allocated video memory
- `WRITE_DATA`: write data to memory using `writel`
- `UNLOCK_VIDEO_MEMORY`: unlock earlier locked video memory
- `SIGNAL`: command from the signal API described in this section
- `UNMAP_USER_MEMORY`: unmap earlier mapped user memory

Userspace can wait for the signal using `USER_SIGNAL` with subcommand `USER_SIGNAL_WAIT`.

- Build and commit the command buffer


Context switching
==================
Clients manage their own context, which is passed to COMMIT preemptively in case a context switch is needed.

It appears that context switching is manual. Every process has to keep its own context structure for 
context switching, and pass this to COMMIT. In case this is needed the kernel will then load the state
from the context buffer.

The context contains a copy of all state that should be preserved when the context has been switched
(when multiple programs are using the GPU).

This has the form of a giant command stream buffer, accompanied by a state map (an array of offsets
into the command stream buffer for every known state), and the address where to put a link
to the main command buffer.

The state `FE.VERTEX_ELEMENT_CONFIG` is handled specially: write only the elements that are used, starting from 0x00600

Used fields in `struct _gcoCONTEXT` from the kernel:

- `id` 
    [in] This id is used to determine wether to switch context
    [out] A unique id for the context is generated the first time a COMMIT is done, with context->id==0
- `hint*` only used when `SECURE_USER` is set
- `logical` and `bufferSize`  (note: `physical` is not used; the dove version of the driver doesn't even have this field in the default configuration)
- `pipe2DIndex`: if this is set, "we have to check pipes", and the pipe is set to initialPipe if needed
- `entryPipe`: this is the pipe that has to be active on entering the passed command buffer (and that holds at the end of the context buffer)
- `initialPipe`: this is the pipe that has to be active on entering the context command buffer
- `currentPipe`: this is the pipe that is active after the passed command buffer
- `inUse`: value at this address is set to gcvTRUE, to mark the context as used. The context is "used" when a context switch happened.

All command buffers are padded with 4 NOPs at the beginning to make place for a PIPE command if needed.
At the end of the command buffer must be place for a LINK (1 NOP + padding).

The other fields are not used by the kernel, only by the user-space driver internally for various purposes. This makes them
uninteresting from a viewpoint of understanding the kernel interface.

Profiling
===============

To enable profiling, the kernel most have been built with `VIVANTE_PROFILER` enabled in `gc_hal_options.h` or the appropriate
`config` file.
   
    USE_PROFILER                        = 1

Vivante also recommends disabling power management features while profiling,

    USE_POWER_MANAGEMENT                = 0

HW profiling registers can be read using the command `READ_ALL_PROFILE_REGISTERS`.

There are also the commands `GET_PROFILE_SETTING` and `SET_PROFILE_SETTING`, which set a flag for 
logging to a file (`vprofiler.xml` by default), but this flag doesn't do anything in the kernel driver,
likely it's meant to be read out by the user space driver.

This will return a structure `gcsPROFILER_COUNTERS`, defined in `GC_HAL_PROFILER.h`, which has the following timers:

Hardware-wise, the memory controller keeps track of these counters in registers `MC_PROFILE_xx_READ`,
switched by corresponding bits in registers `MC_PROFILE_CONFIGx`.

HW static counters (clock rates). These are never filled in by the kernel, it appears, so will likely contain garbage.

        Simply copies the "kernel profile filename" to the returned structure from the kernel configuration.

* `SET_PROFILE_SETTING`

        Get profile settings. Only available if kernel compiled with `VIVANTE_PROFILER` enabled.
        Simply copies the "kernel profile filename" from the passed interface structure into the kernel
        configuration.

* `READ_ALL_PROFILE_REGISTERS`

        Read all 3D profile registers. Only available if kernel compiled with `VIVANTE_PROFILER` enabled.

        Calls: gckHARDWARE_QueryProfileRegisters

* `PROFILE_REGISTERS_2D`
        
        Read all 2D profile registers. Only available if kernel compiled with `VIVANTE_PROFILER` enabled.

        Calls: gckHARDWARE_ProfileEngine2D

* `SET_POWER_MANAGEMENT_STATE`

        Set the power management state.

        Calls: gckHARDWARE_SetPowerManagementState

* `QUERY_POWER_MANAGEMENT_STATE`

        Get the power management state.

        Calls: gckHARDWARE_QueryPowerManagementState / gckHARDWARE_QueryIdle

* `GET_BASE_ADDRESS`

        Get physical base address.

        Out:
        - baseAddress: Physical memory address of internal memory.

        Calls: gckOS_GetBaseAddress

* `SET_IDLE`

        Reserved. Not handled by kernel.

* `QUERY_KERNEL_SETTINGS`

        Get kernel settings.

        Calls: gckKERNEL_QuerySettings

* `RESET`

        Reset the hardware.

        Calls: gckHARDWARE_Reset

* `MAP_PHYSICAL`

        Map physical address into handle.

        Not handled by the kernel on Linux.

* `DEBUG`

        Set debug level and zones.

        Calls: gckOS_SetDebugLevel / gckOS_SetDebugZones

* `CACHE`

        Flush or invalidate the cache.
        NOTE: unimplemented on Linux, and also apparently not called by the blob on Linux.

        In: 
          invalidate: If FALSE, flush the cache (the GPU is going to need the data)
                      if TRUE, flush and invalidate the cache (if the GPU is going to modify the data)
          process: Process handle Logical belongs to or gcvNULL if Logical belongs to the kernel.
          logical: Logical address to flush
          bytes: Size of the address range in bytes to flush

        Calls: gckOS_CacheInvalidate / gckOS_CacheFlush

* `BROADCAST_GPU_STUCK`

        Broadcast GPU stuck.

        Calls: gckOS_Broadcast 

Crash recovery
================

The GPU sometimes crashes when fed with invalid addresses or commands. In these cases it seems like
rebooting the device is the only way to get control over the GPU back. However the kernel does appear
to contain stuck detection and recovery, which will be researched in this section.
Kernel needs to be compiled with `gcdENABLE_TIMEOUT_DETECTION` enabled in `gc_hal_options.h` for this to work.

- `gckCOMMAND_Stall` broadcasts `BROADCAST_GPU_STUCK` when the stall times out.
- `gckEVENT_Submit` broadcasts GPU stuck when no event IDs are available, and the request time out.

This will print the following message:

    !!FATAL!! GPU Stuck
      idle=0x%08X axi=0x%08X cmd=0x%08X

The contents of the `IDLE_STATE`, `AXI_STATUS` and `DMA_ADDRESS` will be printed and then the function
`gckKERNEL_Recovery` is called which tries to recover the GPU from a fatal error.

- Try to do a a soft reset (`gckHARDWARE_Reset`)
- If not supported, set power management state to `gcvPOWER_OFF_RECOVERY`

XXX how to trigger from user space?
