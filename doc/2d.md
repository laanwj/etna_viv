2D engine documentation
========================

Make sure to set the PIPE to 2D before using the 2D engine.

As the complete state footprint is pretty small, it is recommended to program all relevant
2D engine state for an operation (before flusing) at once before a command instead 
of relying on a context being maintained as with 3D rendering.

2D commands
-----------------

- Clear
- Line
- Bit blit
- Stretch blit
- Multi source blit

Video rasterizer
-----------------

- Horizontal filter blit
- Vertical filter blit
- One-pass filter blit

Monochrome blits
-----------------
     
When blitting from `LOCATION_STREAM` make sure that there are
enough bytes available in the stream.
Source size is ignored in the case of monochrome blits.

Mono expansion uses
`SRC_COLOR_FG`
`SRC_COLOR_BG`
to determine the colors to use for 0 and 1 pixels respectively.

In case of `LOCATION_STREAM` source can only draw one rectangle at a time.

Raster operations
------------------
Raster operation foreground and background codes. Even though ROP
is not used in `CLEAR`, `HOR_FILTER_BLT`, `VER_FILTER_BLT` and alpha-enabled
`BIT_BLT`s, ROP code still has to be programmed, because the engine makes the
decision whether source, destination and pattern are involved in the current
operation and the correct decision is essential for the engine to complete
the operation as expected.

ROP builds a lookup table for a logical operation with 2, 3 or 4 inputs
(depending on ROP type). So for a ROP3, for example, the rop pattern will be
2^3=8 bits.

`ROP2_PATTERN` [untested]
    bit 0 destination
    bit 1 pattern

`ROP2_SOURCE` [untested]
    bit 0 destination
    bit 1 source

`ROP3` (uses `ROP_FG` only)
    bit 0 destination
    bit 1 source
    bit 2 pattern

`ROP4` (uses `ROP_FG` and `ROP_BG`)
    bit 0 destination
    bit 1 source
    bit 2 pattern
    bit "3" foreground/background (`ROP_FG` / `ROP_BG`)
    
ROP3/4 examples:

    10101010  0xaa   destination
    01010101  0x55   !destination
    11001100  0xcc   source
    00110011  0x33   !source
    11110000  0xf0   pattern (8x8)
    00001111  0x0f   !pattern (8x8)

Patterns
---------
An repeated 8x8 pattern can be used with 2D engine operations `LINE` and `BIT_BLT`.
